# Production Migration Testing Plan

This document provides a comprehensive test plan for verifying that the migration from the local Strapi development environment to the production Strapi instance was successful.

## üöÄ Overview

The purpose of this testing plan is to ensure that all frontend functionality works correctly with the production Strapi backend. The plan covers authentication, data retrieval, media handling, form submissions, and other critical features.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before beginning testing, ensure:

1. The frontend application is configured to use the production Strapi instance:
   - `PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL=https://miraculous-morning-0acdf6e165.strapiapp.com`
   - `PUBLIC_STRAPI_PORT=443`
   - `PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=production`

2. CORS settings have been configured in the Strapi admin panel to allow requests from your testing environment.

3. You have test user accounts for each role (Family Contact, Funeral Director, etc.).

## üß™ Test Execution Plan

#### 5.3 Other Form Submissions

Test any other forms in the application (contact forms, feedback forms, etc.)

**Expected Results:**
- Form data is sent to the production Strapi instance
- Appropriate success/error messages are displayed
- Data is stored correctly

### 6. CORS Configuration Testing

#### 6.1 Basic CORS Verification

Check browser console for CORS-related errors during all previous tests.

**Expected Results:**
- No CORS errors appear in the browser console

#### 6.2 Preflight Requests

Use browser developer tools to observe preflight (OPTIONS) requests for non-simple requests.

**Expected Results:**
- OPTIONS requests receive appropriate responses with CORS headers
- Subsequent actual requests succeed

### 7. Error Handling Testing

**Expected Results:**
- All operations complete successfully
- UI remains responsive

## üîç Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

- **JWT Token Problems**: Check browser storage to ensure tokens are being stored correctly.
- **Role Assignment**: Verify that user roles are correctly assigned in the Strapi admin panel.

### CORS Issues

- **Missing Headers**: Ensure the Strapi CORS configuration includes all necessary origins.
- **Credentials Handling**: Check if credentials are being included in requests when needed.

### Media Upload Issues

- **File Size Limits**: Verify that file size limits match between frontend and Strapi configuration.
- **Storage Configuration**: Ensure Strapi's upload provider is correctly configured.

### Data Retrieval Issues

- **Missing Data**: Check if data exists in the production database.
- **Permission Issues**: Verify that user roles have appropriate permissions in Strapi.

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered during testing, follow these steps to roll back to the local development environment:

1. Update the `.env` file to use local development settings:
   ```
   PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL=http://localhost
   PUBLIC_STRAPI_PORT=1338
   PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=development
   ```

2. Restart the frontend application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Document all issues encountered with the production instance for future resolution.

4. If using a CI/CD pipeline, revert any deployment commits and redeploy with local development settings.

## üìù Test Results Documentation

For each test section, document:

1. Test status (Pass/Fail)
2. Any issues encountered
3. Screenshots of errors (if applicable)
4. Browser and environment information

## üèÅ Final Verification Checklist

Before considering the migration successful, verify:

- [ ] All authentication flows work correctly
- [ ] All data retrieval operations return expected results
- [ ] Media uploads and retrievals function properly
- [ ] Form submissions save data correctly
- [ ] No CORS errors appear in the console
- [ ] Error handling works as expected
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

## üìä Post-Migration Monitoring

After completing the test plan and verifying the migration was successful:

1. Monitor application logs for unexpected errors
2. Watch for any increase in error rates or response times
3. Gather user feedback on any issues not caught during testing
4. Have a plan for quickly addressing any issues that arise

This test plan provides a comprehensive approach to verifying the successful migration to the production Strapi instance. By methodically testing each aspect of the application's interaction with the backend, you can ensure a smooth transition and identify any issues before they impact users.
